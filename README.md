# Idle

I'm using this repo to explore the ideas of static site generation using node. Promises seems like a weird way to do that and I like to try out weird stuff.

How to run this thang
```
npm start
```
That fires up index.js - I imagine I'll change all of this eventually, but it is a fun place to start.
